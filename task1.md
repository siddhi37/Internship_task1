### **Introduction**
This project involves the implementation of a beam search algorithm for sentence translation, focusing on understanding natural language processing (NLP) concepts and probabilistic modeling. The task is to translate an input sentence into a target language using a simulated translation model and beam search decoding. This exercise is designed to help learners gain hands-on experience with tokenization, probabilistic sequence modeling, and beam search, which are critical components in NLP.

### **Background**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. One of the core tasks in NLP is machine translation, where the goal is to translate text from one language to another. Beam search is a popular decoding algorithm used in machine translation models like neural machine translation (NMT). It efficiently explores multiple translation paths by keeping the most promising sequences at each step, aiming to find the most probable output sequence.

### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this project, learners will be able to:
1. Understand the fundamentals of tokenization and sequence modeling in NLP.
2. Implement a simple beam search decoder for probabilistic sequence generation.
3. Simulate and analyze the process of translating sentences using a basic NLP model.
4. Comprehend the impact of beam width on translation quality and model efficiency.
5. Develop skills in Python programming with a focus on NLP libraries like NLTK.

### **Activities and Tasks**
1. **Introduction to Tokenization:** Learn how to tokenize sentences into words using the NLTK library.
2. **Vocabulary Construction:** Create word-to-index and index-to-word mappings based on the tokenized vocabulary.
